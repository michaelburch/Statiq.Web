    Ordering by something other than a string can be tricky. Since front matter isn't usually typed, sorting by any fields from front matter
    usually sort on their string representation. To use different sorting logic, we first need to convert the front matter into the appropriate
    type and then sort on that. <a href="https://statiq.dev/framework/documents/metadata-values#computed-values">Computed metadata</a> can be
    helpful here because it lets us run code to generate the item being sorted for the archive.

@foreach (IDocument document in Model.GetChildren())
{
    <h5>@Html.DocumentLink(document)</h5>
    <p><b>Post Date:</b> @document.GetString("PostDate")</p>
    @Html.Raw(document.GetString("Excerpt"))
}
